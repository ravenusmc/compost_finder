# Compost Finder
## Intro

The purpose of this project will be to allow people in a neighborhood to find other people in their area who want to turn over their compost materials to them. So, let's say that I'm a gardener and want more compost. I would use this app and locate people within a certain area of me who are willing to turn over compost material to me. I also believe that this same model could be used with Urban Farms who want to ge compostable waste from local restaurants.

I got the idea for this project during my time volunteering at Truly Living Well, an Urban Farm, in Atlanta, GA. On many a day, at the farm, we would talk about composting and how to gather more material for it. I knew, in my own personal garden, that my household is not generating enough organic waste to keep up with my needs. However, if I knew some neighbors that were willing to help me out, I could solve my issue. Thus, the idea for this project was born!

# Issues / other 

I do want to say that I took a lot of information, on my why page, from the website: http://www.toxipedia.org/display/FOC/Composting+101. If I ever launched this site, then I would change some of the information on that 
page or contact them to use it. Information also gathered from https://www.smallfootprintfamily.com/10-things-you-should-not-put-in-a-compost-pile and https://www.smallfootprintfamily.com/100-things-you-can-compost.
