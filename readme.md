# Compost Finder
## Intro

The purpose of this project will be to allow people in a neighborhood to find other people in their area who want to turn over their compost materials to them. So, let's say that I'm a gardener and want more compost. I would use this app and locate people within a certain area of me who are willing to turn over compost material to me. I also believe that this same model could be used with Urban Farms who want to ge compostable waste from local restaurants.
